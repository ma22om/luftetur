Welcome to the Luftetur app!

This is an app created by Martin Rønning with inspiration from Raven Deadman. The source code is
available on GitHub, as well as being available for download on the iOS App Store & Google Play
Store.

The app is not programmed to collect any other personal information other than what is strictly
needed for the app to function. This includes information to create an account (TBD), rough
user location for personalization and precise location for accurate location directions.

Please send me an email if you come across a security concern.

Thanks for reading!

Best regards,
Martin Rønning
